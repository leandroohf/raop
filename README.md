# Random Act of Pizza: (WIP)
    
**This is a work in progress**

In this project data from online community Random Act of Pizza (RAoP)
forum was analyzed. The data is a collection of post where reddit's
users are requesting free pizza. Sentimental analyses were performed
in the data and the findings were used to build a model to predict if
the post written by the user will be successful. The link for the
analysis can be found [here](raop.org) and a better explanation with
more detail can be found in the links below.
